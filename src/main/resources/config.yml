# # This is not needed if you are using Dropbox!
# # Recommended to leave as default, apart from the following values.
# # localhost: This is picked automatically by default so it does not appear.

# #            adding this entry and setting it to 0.0.0.0.
# # port:The Port you specify must be open and not in use from anything else
# #      in your network. Common ports on shared hosting machines are most

# Resource Pack:
# # use-dropbox: Whether the plugin should use the online service Dropbox

# # send-to-player: Whether the player will receive the Resource Pack when
# #                 they join the server. 
# # force-on-join: Whether the players will be kicked if they do not
# #                accept the Resource Pack. Default is true.
# # overwrite-files: Whether a file will be overwritten while merging
# #                  resource packs. Default is true.
# # smooth-leather-armor-texture: Whether the Smooth  Leather Armor

# Permissions:
# # default-permission-type: Determines whether the default permission is
# #                          allow or deny. If this is set to allow, all
# #                          items that do not specify otherwise will be
# #                          disabled and you will have to enable them
# #                          using a permission node of the form:
# #                          "plugin_name.item_name.allow.action"
# #                          If this is set to deny, it will be the
# #                          opposite. Refer to plugin page for more
# #                          info. Default is deny.
